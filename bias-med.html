## Questions for you
### 1. When you read or hear about new research (publication or talk), what are things that would make you trust the result? What would make you skeptical?

### 2. Did you ever investigate it further? What did you do, and how did it go?

Most studies have low prior probability of being true.

Less likely true if:
- Smaller size.
- Smaller effects.
- Many tests conducted.
